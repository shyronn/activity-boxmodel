    <h2>Design Brief</h2>
        
    <p>Simple, direct, memorable and clean are the design tools I felt necessary to not only grab the viewer’s attention, but to compete against the many other adverts in the post-board arena.</p>
    
    <h3>Colour Palette:</h3>
        
    <p>The colours I chose to employ are three of the most saturated colours a digital printer can produce: Cyan Magenta and Yellow. The effect is commanding and bold. The secondary reason for this colour palette is to clearly convey to the audience that this play is a comedy. With a subject matter that deals with someone contemplating suicide, by jumping off the side of a building, I wanted the viewer to know instantly know that this play was not a horror or tragedy —but rather a comedic production that would ensure laughter throughout.</p>
        
    <h4>Graphic:</h4>
        
    <p>In place of a man jumping off a building, I thought it would be interesting and creative if the man jumped off the number seven —simplistic and fitting, seeing that the play takes place on the seventh storey. The seven blue buildings, with one single window each, separately represent the play’s seven stories. The dissimilar pitched roof building is analogous to the main character: a crack suggests that it’s about to break under pressure. But as the play unfolds, everyone quickly observes that, like the main character, none of the stories/people are perfect either.</p>
        
    <h5>Texture:</h5>
        
    <p>In place of literally using brick as exterior imagery in the poster to create “roughness”, I chose to convey the same character but in the form of textured concrete.  To balance this hardness, I illustrated the main background as if imagining the building’s interior texture: wallpaper.</p>
