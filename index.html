    <h2>Design Brief</h2>
        
    <p>Simple, direct, memorable and clean were the design tools I felt necessary to not only grab the viewer’s attention, but to compete against the many other adverts in the post-board arena</p>
    
    <h3>Colour Palette:</h3>
        
    <p>The colours I chose to employed are three of the most saturated colours a digital printer can produce: Cyan Magenta and Yellow. The effect is bold and commanding. The secondary reason for this colour choice is to clearly convey to the audience that this play is a comedy. With a subject matter that deals with someone contemplating suicide by jumping off the side of a building, I wanted the viewer to know instantly that this play was not a horror or tragedy —but rather a comedic play that would ensure they would be laughing throughout.</p>
        
    <h4>Graphic:</h4>
        
    <p>In place of a man jumping off a building, I thought it would be more interesting and creative if the man jumped off the number seven —simplistic and fitting, seeing that the play takes place on the seventh storey. The seven blue buildings, with one single window each, separately represent the play’s seven stories. The dissimilar pitched roof building is analogous to the main character: the crack suggests that it’s about to break under pressure. But as the play unfolds, everyone quickly observes that like the main character, none of the stories are perfect either.</p>
        
    <h5>Texture:</h5>
        
    <p>In place of literally using brick as exterior imagery in the poster to create “roughness”, I chose to convey the same character but in the form of a concrete texture.  To balance this hardness, I illustrated the background as if imagining the interior building texture: wallpaper.</p>
